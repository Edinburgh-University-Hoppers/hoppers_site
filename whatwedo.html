<h3>Events</h3>


<p>Considered Hoppers' main focus, our events concentrate on gathering women interested in technology, as well as providing the opportunity for them to develop their skills in this field. Here's the range of events we offer: </p>

<br/>
<!--
<h4>Hoppers Hackathon</h4>
<p>On 18-19 February 2012 Hoppers will be coding 24+ hours for <a href="http://www.msf.org.uk/" target="_blank">charity</a>, skill and funsies!</p>
<p>Hoppers is hosting a weekend hackathon to improve your skills in mobile and web development. Prior knowledge is not required as we encourage everyone to come along! Topics will range from Javascript, to iPhone, backends like AppEngine and possibly Rails. The goal is to produce some application that will do some stuff - i.e. completely up to you and your imagination! </p>
<p>Moreover, we'll be camping out in the Informatics Forum to raise money for Medecins Sans Frontieres, so please consider <a href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/edihoppers" target="_blank">donating</a> :).
</p>
<p>If you're interested in coming, please sign up by attending on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/150409901744123/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></p>

<br/>
<h4>Hoppers Hack Nights</h4>

<p>Hoppers decided to host a bi-weekly hacknights where anyone can come and do some work, may this be personal projects you want to dedicate set time to, or university related assignments. You can work together or alone, but know that there we're always around to try and answer any questions that you may have and provide some snacks to keep you going!</p>

<p>They're every other Thursday night, starting from 2 February 2012. You can find us from around 6.30pm in AT 4.12 (the big lab on level four).</p> 

<br/>
<h4>The annual Hoppers conference, with a focused topic</h4>
     <p>Every October we organise a large, conference-like, event, open to all female students, young professionals, and interested individuals. Topics vary from year to year, but our goal remains the same: get girls connected and get girls informed. Many have questions regarding future careers, certain technologies, companies, and so on. Here's a chance to learn more about it! </p>

<p>Example of previous years:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Fall 2009: Inspiring Women in IT (i.e. talks from leading women who came from an IT background, across all industries) 
                    Companies present: Google, Barclays, P&G</li>
<li>Fall 2010: Female Developers Conference (i.e. coding workshops on different skills and technologies)
                    Companies present: Google, JPMorgan, Adobe, Interface3, PyrusMarus</li>
<li>Fall 2011: <a href="http://hoppers-kickstartyourcareer.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">Kickstart Your Career</a> (i.e. information about CV's, interviews, and internships - from the insiders!)
                    Companies present: Google, LivingSocial, Morgan Stanley</li>
</ul> !-->

<br/>
<h4>Lunch & Learn</h4>
<p>The Hoppers lab lunches are a good chance for girls to learn something interesting, mingle and chat while enjoying some quality free food (Pizza is quality, right?). Execellent for meeting coursemates. Disclaimer: lifelong friendships may be formed. </p>

<br/>
<h3>Travel </h3>


<h4>As a Student of Edinburgh University:</h4>
     <p>We're currently setting up a travel scheme to enable more of our students to travel to conferences related, but not restricted, to academia and technology. Our aim is to encourage both undergraduates and postgraduates to attend these events as they provide excellent opportunies for expanding knowledge, discovering interests and meeting invaluable contacts in both the industry and academia. </p>

<br/>
<h4>As an attendee of one of our events:</h4>
     <p>We would love to fund travel to our events, however, this is not always possible as it depends on the budget available to us per event we organise. If we do secure finances to allow for this, we advertise the possibility along with the event.</p>
